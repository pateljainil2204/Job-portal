# üöÄ Job Portal Management System (Backend)

A secure, scalable **Job Portal Management System** built with the **MERN stack (Node.js, Express, MongoDB)**. This backend application provides a robust API for managing job postings, applications, and user accounts with comprehensive role-based access control.


## ‚ú® Features at a Glance

| Category | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **üîê User Authentication** | Secure registration and login using **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens). |
| **üîç Job Interaction** | View all available jobs, search by title/keyword, apply, and withdraw applications. |
| **üíº Admin Control** | Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) management for job postings, users, and applications. |
| **üõ°Ô∏è Security** | Role-Based Access Control (**RBAC**) and activity logging for all actions. |
| **üõ†Ô∏è Developer-Friendly** | RESTful API design, Postman collection for immediate testing, and easy integration with any modern frontend (e.g., React, Angular). |

 ## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

Follow these simple steps to get the Job Portal backend running locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/pateljainil2204/Job-portal
cd Job-portal
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```
npm install 
```

### 3. Create .env File

Inside the root directory, create a .env file and add
```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
```

### 4. Run the Server
```
npm run dev
```

the API will run at:
   http://localhost:5000
    
## üîê Authentication & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The system employs **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for secure authentication and enforces **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**. User access is determined by two primary assigned roles: **User** (encompassing Job Seekers and Recruiters) or **Admin**.

***

### Security Note

All authenticated requests **must** securely transmit the JWT token using the `Authorization` header.

‚úÖ **Correct Header Format:**

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

‚ùå **Incorrect Practice:** Never expose authentication credentials or tokens in URL parameters or query strings.

### Role Permissions Matrix

This simplified model outlines the permissions for key actions based on the user's role:

| Action / Resource | **User** (Job Seeker/Recruiter) | **Admin** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **View Job Listings (All)** | Read | Read |
| **Submit Application** | Create (Job Seeker) | Read (Monitor Applications) |
| **Manage Own Profile** | Update (Own) | Full Control |
| **Create New Job Posting** | Limited (Recruiter Role) | Create |
| **System & User Management** | None | Full Control |


## üß™ Postman Collection (API Usage)

A ready-to-use **Postman Collection** is provided to allow developers to immediately test and interact with all the API endpoints. This is the fastest way to explore the API's functionality, including registration, authentication, job interaction, and admin operations.

***

### Collection Link

You can import the entire collection directly into your Postman workspace using the link below:

üîó **Postman Collection Link:**
```
https://pateljainil22-2328610.postman.co/workspace/JAINIL-PATEL's-Workspace~d608882a-766a-44c6-89e1-0d78fca8b51c/collection/48171917-33c1f662-5028-49b4-bb39-776de33e54c6?action=share&source=copy-link&creator=48171917
```
**Note:** Ensure your local server is running (`npm run dev`) before testing the endpoints. Remember to set the **JWT token** as a **Bearer Token** in the Authorization tab for any protected routes.


## üí° Future Scope & Roadmap

The following milestones outline the strategic evolution and long-term vision for the Job Portal Management System.

***

### V1.1: Quality & Integration (Short-Term Focus)

This phase focuses on hardening the current structure and optimizing core functionality.

* **Testing and CI/CD:** Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests across the application tier. Integrate Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines to automate testing and deployment upon code merges.
* **Search Optimization:** Integrate specialized search technology (e.g., advanced MongoDB indexing strategies) to enable faster, more intelligent job searching and filtering.
* **Performance & UI/UX:** Refine mobile responsiveness and perform detailed performance audits to optimize load times and enhance the overall user experience.

### V2.0: Advanced Features & Monetization (Mid-Term Focus)

This phase introduces new features to drive user engagement and platform sustainability.

* **Payment Gateway Integration:** Implement secure payment processing to support premium features, such as sponsored job listings or employer subscription tiers.
* **Real-Time Communication:** Integrate a module for direct messaging or chat functionality between Recruiters and Job Seekers to streamline communication and follow-ups.
* **Advanced Analytics:** Develop a comprehensive, real-time analytics dashboard for Recruiters and Admins, providing deep insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) like applicant drop-off rates and source tracking.

### Long-Term Strategy

These strategic goals aim to ensure the longevity and technological superiority of the platform.

* **TypeScript Migration:** Transition the codebase from JavaScript to **TypeScript** to improve code quality, enforce type safety, enhance maintainability, and improve the developer tooling experience.
* **AI Integration:** Explore incorporating machine learning or predictive AI models to improve job/candidate matching and provide personalized recommendations for both job seekers and recruiters.
* **Cloud Storage Integration:** Implement robust cloud storage solutions (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for securely handling resume uploads and other large media files.
